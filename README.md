# a2cparser

A little file converter that I threw together over a weekend while exploring old files. Absolutely no guarantees, use at your own risk!

Processes .a2c files and outputs a readable but still binary file.

## Build

You need a recent MSVC to build the project. However you should be able to `g++ main.cpp` since everything is bundled together.
